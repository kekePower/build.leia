# build.leia - A shell script to build Kodi Leia from source

## Description
This is a complete hack to fetch(clone), update(pull), compile and install [Kodi](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc) from source.

It uses the Z Shell (ZSH) as I find it more than capable for my needs.

The script also uses **sudo** to install Kodi and the binary-addons. Please make sure you are in the **sudoers** list.

Default installation dir is **/opt/Leia**. This can be changed by editing the PREFIX variable in **build.leia**.

See **build.leia --help** for your options.

### Requirements

* Standard requirements for building [Kodi on Linux](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/blob/master/docs/README.linux)
* [ZSH](http://www.zsh.org/)
* [git](https://github.com/git/git)
* You must be in the sudoers file
	* Unless you want to install Kodi to your home directory. Then you'll have to edit the PREFIX setting and remove the sudo commands from the script.

## Getting the source

If you want to be on the cutting-edge, you can download the **master** branch. This will have a lot of bugs until the next major version is released.

To get the latest, stable version, please use the **v1.x** branch.

**git clone -b v1.x https://github.com/kekePower/build.leia**

## Options

### Fresh start

The script will first check to see if you have the Kodi Leia source in the directory specified in **etc/build.leia.conf**. If it's not there, it will ask you if you want it to clone the source from Github.

It will then ask you if you also want to compile the binary-addons later.

### Command line options

**build.leia** - The default is the same as **build.leia --with=clean,addons**

**build.leia --help** will show you a few examples of use

**build.leia --with=** - This is where the magic happens.

Your options are:

**--with=clean** - This will remove the **build-kodi** directory and recreate it.

**--with=dirty** - This will simply pull the updated source and compile as is.

**--with=addons** - This will clean and compile the binary-addons.

**--with=no-git** - This will skip pulling for updates from Github and just carry on with the compilation. This can be used if one compilation has failed after an update and you want to run it again.

**--with=force** - This will compile Kodi even if there are no new updates from Github.

You can use any of these options together, except from **clean** and **dirty**.

**build.leia --with=clean,addons,force** will remove the **kodi-build** directory, recreate it, check to see if there are updates from Github and even if there are no new updates, it will continue with the compilation and lastly it will do a **distclean** for the binary-addons and re-compile them.

## Troubleshooting

If you're experiencing problems, it really doesn't have anything to do with the script.

Please cd into your Leia source code: **cd ${HOME}/kodi/Leia/kodi-build** and run the following command: **cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/Leia**

You will see the complete output of the command and possibly find you're missing some libraries and/or tools necessary to compile Kodi. Install the missing libraries and/or tools and try again. Once you've sorted all this out, you're ready to run the script.

## Translations

I only know two languages, Norwegian and English, and therefore there are only these two availale.

If you want to help out with translation, please fork the project and copy the language files from **include/build.leia/language/**.

The **en_US.inc** is the most up-to-date file. I haven't fixed the Norwegian one yet.

## The road ahead

I've a lot of thoughts about how to make this script even more robust. At the moment they're basically just a mess in my head, but I'll try to plot them down in a coherent way.

* I'd like to see a way for the script to check for known dependencies
	* If some are missing, download them (git?), compile and install them
	* The main problem here is that we can't really catch missing dependecies of these unless we go through all of them manually and set up some sort of order
* Make the installer more robust when it comes to updating.
	* Sometimes there are changes to the config file and I'd like to keep the local changes while updating with the new settings without adding in the REMOVEME string.
* ~~Move the hardcoded text from build.leia into the language files~~
* Perhaps make an option (GLOBAL_INSTALL?) that en/disables the use of sudo
* More to come...
